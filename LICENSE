# License Unknown

It isn't obvious to me what the license for the original post (now accessible via https://jeroensangers.wordpress.com/2014/05/22/omnifocus-2-configuration/) is published under.

In absense of that information, I'm duplicating the items in that post with some of the original language, with the hopes that I'm not violating the author's license. I'm not attempting to pass their work off as my own, it's merely an often-referenced starting point for these hidden configuration options.

In the event that collective edits and updates to this work from myself or others are not in contention with a more restrictive license from the original author, I would like to keep things in the spirit of the original and propose Attribution-ShareAlike CC BY-SA.
